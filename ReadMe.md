## Installation

To get started with the code in this repository, it is recommended to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. Here's how you can do it:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn-pandas.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```
   cd learnPandas
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment using `venv`:

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:
   
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   
   - For macOS/Linux:
   
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Congratulations! You now have a virtual environment set up with the necessary dependencies installed.

## Problem Statements

In this repository, you will find solutions to the following problems using Pandas:

1. Load and read specific rows.
2. Get to know about the columns.
3. Determine the total number of rows.
4. Obtain information about each column.
5. Get information about the overall dataset.
6. Determine the shape of the dataset.
7. Split the dataset into two.
8. Join/Merge the dataset.

Filteration of the data:

1. Count the number of superchargers in each state and city.
2. Find the maximum number of stalls in each city.
3. Remove null values in the "open" data column.
4. Apply a function to convert "kw" into integer data types.
5. Find the most recent open superchargers.

Each problem is accompanied by a solution in Python, leveraging the powerful functionalities of Pandas. You can explore the code and modify it as per your requirements. Feel free to contribute your own solutions or suggest improvements to the existing ones.

Happy learning and exploring the world of Pandas!
